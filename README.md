### Assignments

Please find my assignments for CSCI-UA.0480-002  - iOS Programming Spring 2014

iOS HW1:
    Using Objective C, create a mutable dictionary containing a website as
  a key, and a username, password, and (integer) count as values.
  
iOS HW2:
    Continuing from HW1, create a mutable array that holds siteValues. Each
  siteValue, named by its website name, contains a username, password,
  and (integer) count.
  Using storyboard, created a page that showcase the current siteValueâ€™s
  username, password, count, and website. Had buttons that could
  increment the count and traverse through the array.
  Created a second view controller that let the user create a new
  siteValue. The new siteValue would be added to the array.
